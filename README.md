# Predictive-maintenance

Machine maintenance is one of the biggest pain points of manufacturing companies, leading to major downtime and eventually, losses for the firm. In the day of AI and machine learning, it is now possible to use algorithms to predict when if a machine is likely to break or not. 

Using a sample dataset from kaggle.com, I have explored the data and built machine learning models that would predict if a machine would break or not, using the available features which include the following response variables:
1. Lifetime of machine
2. Operating conditions
  Moisture indicator
  Pressure indicator
  Temperature indicator
3. Machine provider
4. Machine user

This is a preliminary code for exploring some of the classification algorithms, to get a sense of which model performs well for this particular dataset.
